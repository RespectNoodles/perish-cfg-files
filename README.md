# perish-cfg-files
A collection of my Team Fortress 2 .cfg files

## This includes: 
# class-configs (cfg files for specific classes)
-> engineer.cfg
-> soldier.cfg

# add-on-configs (cfg files that are an optional extension you can exec in-game)
-> allclasses.cfg   (A customisable config for all classes)
-> autoexec.cfg     (A copy of my autoexec config)
-> ctap.cfg         (Rocket Jumping Assistance Config)
-> jump.cfg         (Private Server Soldier Config)
-> sentry.cfg       (Private Server Engineer Config)

# Please Note:
- I only Rocket Jump in this game and this is the reason for why most - if not all of my custom configs are  tailored around PRIVATE SERVERS
- I am new to uploading on GitHub but will be attempting to complete this challenge and work through the difficulties
- The code in these .cfg files are a combination of Online YouTube Tutorials, Team Fortress Wiki (Mainly the Scripting Page) and Original Thought that were used as references
- All code you see has been hand-typed by me over the course of 200 or so hours... and a lot of self studying.
